This sensor board is designed around the Vishay VCNT2030, a new Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) short range reflective sensor.

The current-related resistors were chosen following the Vishay application note for a long distance / low reflectivity scenario. Thus, for optimal performance the board should be supplied at 5V, although the Send input is buffered by a small MOSFET with a Vgs of 1.8V.
